# Wordle on the Command Line

This project uses Python to create a wordle game which can be played on the terminal. I built it alongside the 'Build a Wordle Clone With Python and Rich' article 
[(https://realpython.com/python-wordle-clone/)] as an introduction into creating applications accessible via the command line. 

### The files
To create the catalogue of words used for the game, I created a script (*create_wordlist.py*) that would run through a text file (*AliceInWonderland.txt*) and copy every single word to its own row in another text file (*wordlist.txt*). The script that contains the code of the game and the command line GUI is *wordle.py*.

### How to use
1) Download the directory to your local computer

2) Create a virtual environment in order to install python, pathlib, random and rich    (??)

3) Run the wordle.py file in your command line and have a go!
